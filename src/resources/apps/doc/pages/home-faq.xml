                <title>What is Orbeon Forms?</title>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms (formerly Orbeon PresentationServer (OPS)) is an open source forms solution that
                    handles the complexity of forms typical of the enterprise or government. It is delivered to standard
                    web browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera) thanks to XForms and Ajax
                    technology, with no need for client-side software or plugins. Orbeon Forms allows you to build fully
                    interactive forms with features that include as-you-type validation, optional and repeated sections,
                    always up-to-date error summaries, PDF output, full internationalization, and controls like
                    auto-completion, tabs, dialogs, trees and menus. Orbeon Forms already supports parts of the XForms
                    1.1 specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other web application platforms based on Java objects or scripting languages, Orbeon Forms is
                    based on XML documents and XForms. This leads to an architecture perfectly suited for the tasks of
                    capturing, processing, and presenting XML data (in particular form data), and does not require
                    writing any Java, JavaScript or other scripting code at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms is built around a user-friendly Ajax-based XForms engine, which brings W3C XForms to
                    standard browsers, and the <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL engine</a>, a mature,
                    high-performance XML pipeline engine for processing XML data.
                </p>

                <title>Is Orbeon Forms an XForms Engine?</title>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms does contain an XForms engine, which we refer to as the Orbeon Forms XForms engine. It
                    also contains an XML pipeline engine running the XPL pipeline language, an application controller
                    (the Page Flow Controller or PFC), and built-in components to perform XSLT transformations,
                    database access, and more. Needless to say, Orbeon Forms ships with examples and documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are free to use Orbeon Forms only for its XForms functionality, but you can also leverage more
                    of Orbeon Forms to build your forms-based application.

                <title>Why did we rename Orbeon PresentationServer to Orbeon Forms?</title>
                <p>
                    Renaming a product is not something to be taken lightly. However we feel that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <i>Orbeon Forms</i> better reflects the fact that forms have been the main focus of our
                            development efforts since 2004.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This new face will help potential users understand more easily what the platform can do for
                            them.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Orbeon Forms</i> is just an easier name to remember!</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We are encouraged in this decision by the fact that almost all current users build complex web forms
                    using our Ajax-based XForms engine. The name change also conveys that we plan to keep focusing on
                    form-related capabilities in the future like we have done in the last two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to precise the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We are not creating a separate product: <i>Orbeon Forms</i> is simply the new name of
                            Orbeon PresentationServer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Other XML technologies like XSLT and XML pipelines remain an important part of the
                            platform.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>And of course, <i>Orbeon Forms</i> remains an open source solution!</p>

                <title>What is XForms?</title>
                <p>
                    W3C XForms is a standard, markup-based, declarative, XML- and HTML-friendly user interface
                    technology particularly adapted to building complex forms. XForms makes it easy to build dynamic
                    user interfaces able to talk to XML services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XForms is a W3C Recommendation since October 2003, with a second edition of the 1.0 published in
                    March 2006. The XForms Working Group is, as of August 2006, working on XForms 1.1, due in late 2006
                    or 2007, before embarking on XForms 1.2 or XForms 2.0! Please visit <a
                    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">XForms - The Next Generation of Web Forms</a> for more
                    information about XForms direct from W3C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XForms aims at replacing HTML forms, but it is not strictly tied to HTML. The main goal of XForms is
                    to make web forms design easier, allowing the developer to write less client-side scripting (or
                    none at all), and less server-side code thanks to a feature-rich declarative approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits of XForms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear separation between data captured and presentation (separation of concerns)</li>
                    <li>Flexible, structured XML-based data model: define your data model as an XML document, then create forms accessing the data</li>
                    <li>Built-in facilities for validation and data integrity based on XML Schema and/or assertions</li>
                    <li>Declarative approach requiring less / no scripting at all, in particular thanks to declarative events and actions</li>
                    <li>Ease of internationalization</li>
                    <li>Support for a variety of devices</li>
                    <li>W3C standard</li>
                    <li>Not tied to a particular platform or language such as Java or .NET</li>

                <title>How much of the XForms specification does Orbeon Forms support?</title>
                <p>
                    The Orbeon Forms implementation is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">W3C XForms
                    1.0 (Second Edition) Recommendation</a> (14 March 2006). The XForms NG engine in Orbeon Forms 3.5
                    is close to supporting all of the XForms 1.0 specification. For more detailed information on what
                    features are supported in the latest version of Orbeon Forms, see the <a
                    href="reference-xforms-compliance">XForms Compliance</a> section of the documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms also supports several features from XForms 1.1 (in draft as of August 2006), as well as
                    extensions such as new widgets (autocomplete, tree, menu, dialog, etc.).
                </p>

            <section added="2006-10-27">
                <title>I hear that XForms is not well supported in web browsers. This is a problem, right?</title>
                <p>
                    No, this is not a problem at all, because XForms can run on the server, in the same way that other
                    web applications technologies like PHP, ASP, JavaServer Faces or Ruby run on the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You run XForms on the server by installing the Orbeon Forms XForms engine on your server. The XForms engine
                    translates your XForms pages to HTML, CSS and JavaScript that your browser understands. Your web
                    browser sees a regular Ajax application, but as a developer you write standard XForms instead of
                    JavaScript!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running XForms on the server has even several benefits over running it in the client:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Users don't have to upgrade their web browser or install plugins or extensions. You can use
                            and develop with XForms today and target over 90% of the users on the web.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The data used by your XForms application remains safely on the server. With client-side
                            implementations, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to send confidential
                            information to the XForms engine, as that information may be seen by the user.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You can upgrade your XForms implementation at a single location on your server instead of
                            waiting for users ot upgrade their browsers when bugs are fixed or new features are
                            implemented.
                        </p>

                <title>What is a server-side XForms implementation?</title>
                <p>
                    Historically, the XForms specification assumed that XForms was implemented on the client-side,
                    natively within a web browser. But as discussed <a href="#xforms-browsers">here</a>, XForms-based
                    applications can use server-side or hybrid implementations that share XForms processing between
                    server-side code and client-side code and rely on Ajax technology. Orbeon Forms features such an
                    Ajax-based implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A server-side implementation of XForms translates your forms described in terms of the XForms
                    specification into HTML, CSS and JavaScript code understood by your web browser. The following
                    diagram shows a high-level overview of the architecture of an Ajax-based  XForms implementation:

                <title>What are the XForms Classic and XForms NG engines?</title>
                <p>
                    Up to version 2.8, Orbeon Forms featured a pure server-side XForms engine with limited XForms
                    functionality. With version 3.0, Orbeon Forms features a much enhanced XForms engine, with support
                    for almost the entire XForms specification, with the intent to completely support XForms 1.0 and
                    XForms 1.1 in the future. The older XForms engine has been informally dubbed "XForms Classic", and
                    the new XForms engine "XForms NG".
                </p>
                <p>
                    For backward compatibility reasons, the XForms Classic engine is still present in Orbeon Forms 3.5.
                    We plan over time to allow XForms NG to support non-JavaScript, non-Ajax browsers as well,
                    therefore making XForms Classic obsolete in Orbeon Forms.

                <p>
                    If you are using Orbeon Forms 2.8 or earlier, you are using XForms Classic. If you are using Orbeon
                    Forms 3.0 or later, then you may be using XForms Classic or XForms NG, but there is an easy way to
                    tell: if a <code>&lt;page></code> entry in your page flow features an <code>xforms</code>
                    attribute, then and only then that page is using XForms Classic. Otherwise, if the page view
                    contains at least one XForms model under its <code>xhtml:head</code> element, then it is using
                    XForms NG.

                <title>Should I keep using the XForms Classic engine?</title>
                <p>
                    The XForms Classic engine is available only for backward compatibility. It is deprecated and may be
                    removed in the future. If you are starting an application from scratch with Orbeon Forms 3.5, we
                    strongly advise against using XForms Classic. If you are migrating to Orbeon Forms 3.5, we advise
                    starting migrating XForms NG. You can keep your existing pages working with XForms Classic, and
                    write new pages with XForms NG. Over time, you can migrate existing XForms Classic pages to XForms
                    NG, making for a smooth transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of Orbeon Forms 3.5, only one feature of XForms Classic have not yet made it into XForms NG:
                    support for browsers with very limited JavaScript functionality (non-Ajax mode). In time, we hope to
                    bring these features to XForms NG as well, therefore completely deprecating XForms Classic.

                    provides an elegant abstraction that greatly simplifies form handling.

                    With Orbeon Forms 2.8 or earlier, or if you are using XForms Classic with Orbeon Forms 3.0 or
                    later, make sure that you have the correct submission method and encoding in your XForms model:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <xml-source show-namespaces="false" xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms">

                    With Orbeon Forms 3.0 and XForms NG, uploaded files can only be retrieved with a submission with

                <p>
                    This happens because Orbeon Forms uses XPath 2.0 expressions instead of XPath 1.0 expressions as
                    mandated by XForms 1.0 and XForms 1.1. This allows much greater flexibility in the expressions you
                    can use in Orbeon Forms (and once you have tasted XPath 2.0, you can't go back to XPath 1.0!). For
                    more information, see <a href="reference-xforms-ng#xforms-xpath-20">Note About XPath 2.0

                <title>Can I mix and match XForms and JSP?</title>
                <p>
                    Yes, you can use JSP alongside XForms, even within the same web app. You can "call" JSP by
                    redirecting or forwarding using the <a href="processors-other#redirect-processor">Redirect
                    processor</a>. You can also use the Servlet Include generator to include the content produced by a
                    JSP. Finally, you can use the Servlet Filter generator and implement JSP post-processing with Orbeon
                    Forms.

                <title>Can I mix and match XForms and JavaServer Faces?</title>
                <p>
                    It all depends on what you are trying to achieve with this integration. Technically, you can write a
                    page in JSP + JSF that produces XForms, which can then be processed by the Orbeon Forms XForms
                    engine using a Servlet filter approach. But mixing JSF components with XForms components can cause
                    difficulties related to the way each component set handles form submissions and state. In
                    particular:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        If you use non-AJAX JSF components, the standard JSF components (buttons, etc.) will perform
                        HTML form submissions to the server, which then reevaluates the JSF component tree to produce an
                        updated page that is then sent back to the client. If you do this and your page contains XForms
                        components as well, you will lose the state of your XForms controls when the page reloads.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        If you use AJAX JSF components (we have no experience whatsoever with those), there could be
                        conflicts due to the JavaScript libraries those components use vs. the ones we use in Orbeon
                        Forms.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Feel free to experiment with JSF and XForms together, but at the moment we recommend using either
                    JSF or XForms exclusively in a given page. However you can very well use JSF for some pages, and
                    XForms for other pages within the same application.

                <title>Can I run XForms within JSR-168 portlets?</title>
                <p>
                    As of Orbeon Forms 3.5, it is possible to use the Orbeon Forms XForms engine within the Java Portlet
                    (JSR-168) compliant Liferay portal, thanks to kind sponsoring by Atkins Transport Systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that Orbeon Forms will work within other JSR-168 portals, or that only minor
                    adjustments will be needed in such cases. Please report your experience to the <a
                    href="http://www.orbeon.com/forms/mailing-list">ops-users</a> mailing-list!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great thing about Orbeon Forms and portlets is that there is very little difference if any
                    between writing an application working in a portlet vs. a servlet. In fact, most of the Orbeon
                    Forms XForms examples work unmodified as portlets. You can use some particularities of portlets,
                    like preferences, and you have to be careful about paths to serve resources, but otherwise portlets
                    are transparent to the developer. This contrasts with many other web platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, Orbeon Forms gives you the flexibility to write an application that works in
                    standalone mode, and allows you to migrate to a portlet environment at minimal cost. This contrasts
                    with many other web application technologies, which sometimes require you to rewrite your
                    application entirely to fit within a portlet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>HISTORICAL NOTE: There has been a lot of code in Orbeon Forms to support JSR-168 since late
                    2003 already. When this code was written, the JSR-168 specification was not final and no JSR-168
                    container was available. So Orbeon developped a container based on draft specifications for testing.
                    This code was used until recently to run the Orbeon Forms examples portal: examples were actually
                    using the portlet code and running as portlets, and the examples portal is an early JSR-168 portal.
                    Note that this is no longer the case with Orbeon Forms 3.5, where the example applications portal
                    does not use JSR-168 for performance and simplicity reasons.</i>

                <p>
                    We develop all our applications and forms using an XML editor. This is the only way you can leverage
                    all the features of XForms today, especially the more complex ones like events and actions. This
                    means that we do not have a visual tool to recommend officially. You may however try the Intalio
                    designer. Trial versions are available <a href="http://www.intalio.com/">from their web site</a>
                    once you register.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our perception is that visual tools tend to be of little use for actual developers except for the
                    first few steps of development (and this is not only true for XForms but also for other frameworks
                    like JavaServer Faces), so we advise not to have too high expectations when it comes to visual
                    tools. However, we reckon that helping developers during the first stages of application development
                    is valuable and we would like in the future to offer such a tool, most likely web-based (and itself
                    implemented with XForms!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have good experience with a visual tool, please be sure to let us know.

                <title>Can I use JavaScript to modify the page DOM and add or remove XForms controls?</title>
                <p>
                    No, because your JavaScript code will run within the web browser, which doesn't know anything about
                    XForms controls. All the web browser sees is an HTML DOM (Document Object Model), which represents
                    the HTML document produced by Orbeon Forms when it transforms XForms+XHTML into plain HTML. That DOM
                    does not include in XForms elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, the Orbeon XForms implementation works server-side in order to support currently deployed
                    browsers. It achieves this by sending to web browsers not XForms (which they wouldn't understand),
                    but HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (which they do understand).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you just want to conditionally include XForms controls when the page is loaded, you can use an
                    XSLT page view. If you want to control the showing or hiding of XForms controls after the page is
                    loaded, you can use XForms relevance or switch/case. Currently, the only thing you can't do is
                    dynamically add and remove trees of controls in a running XForms page.

                    href="/doc/reference-page-flow">Page Flow</a> Controller (PFC). While these additional building
                    blocks are often useful to put together your form-based applications, you may not have a need for
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The good news is that Orbeon Forms is very configurable and you are not forced to use XML pipelines
                    or the PFC. Users have been successfuylly using the Orbeon Forms XForms engine with JSP/Struts or
                    PHP. Please visit <a href="reference-xforms-java">Using the Orbeon Forms XForms Engine with Java

                <title>How do I design forms in Orbeon Forms?</title>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms does not come with a visual forms designer. You create forms by writing XHTML pages
                    that contain embedded XForms markup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms 3.5 comes with a <a href="intro-tutorial">new tutorial</a> that explains step by step
                    how to create your first forms. In the meanwhile, we recommend you look at the sample Orbeon Forms
                    applications that you find under your WAR file's <code>WEB-INF/resources/apps</code> directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also note that Orbeon provides services around Orbeon Forms, including training. Please visit our

                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to be able to provide a web-based tool to help build forms.

                <title>What is the matter about this <code>/xforms-server-submit</code> I am seeing?</title>
                <p>
                    Remember that the Orbeon Forms XForms engine runs for the most part on the server. This means that
                    when you perform an XForms submission that uses HTTP, that submission usually originates from the
                    server, not from the client. Consider the following submission:
                </p>
                <xml-source show-namespaces="false">
                    <xforms:submission xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms" ref="instance('my-instance')"
                                       method="post" action="http://my.example.com/service" replace="all"/>
                </xml-source>
                <p>
                    This is how this submission is processed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The server part of Orbeon Forms tells the Orbeon Forms client (in your web browser) to
                            perform a <code>POST</code> submission at the special Orbeon Forms URL
                            <code>/xforms-server-submit</code>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Orbeon Forms responds to that URL and issues an HTTP POST to
                            <code>http://my.example.com/service</code>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Orbeon Forms forwards the result of the HTTP request to your web browser.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is why you see <code>/xforms-server-submit</code> in URL bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally, you would like to see <code>http://my.example.com/service</code> appear in your URL bar,
                    but technically this is hard to achieve for the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The only way to POST XML documents from a browser is to use the XmlHttpRequest object, and
                            if you do that, you cannot easily, if at all, implement the <code>replace="all"</code>
                            functionality.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There are limitations as to what URLs your browser can talk to from a given page, for
                            security reasons (this is known as cross-domain requests).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In short we don't believe we will solve this problem perfectly in the short-term, unless we get
                    clever suggestions as to how this can be done. However, "nice" client-side URLs are already used in
                    the following cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When using the <code>method="get"</code> method with <code>replace="all"</code>:
                        </p>
                        <xml-source show-namespaces="false">
                            <xforms:submission xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms" ref="instance('my-instance')"
                                               method="get" action="http://my.example.com/service" replace="all"/>
                        </xml-source>
                        <p>
                            Note that this assumes the following property is set in <code>properties.xml</code>:
                        </p>
                        <xml-source show-namespaces="false">
                            <property as="xs:boolean" name="oxf.xforms.optimize-get-all" value="true"/>
                        </xml-source>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When using <code>xforms:load</code> instead of <code>xforms:submission</code>:
                        </p>
                        <xml-source show-namespaces="false">
                            <xforms:load xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms" resource="http://my.example.com/service"/>
                        </xml-source>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Finally, note that performing submission from the server offers certain advantages, including solving
                    cross-domain access.

                <title>What is an XML pipeline and why do I care?</title>
                <p>
                    XML pipelining is an approach to processing XML where the inputs and outputs of
                    multiple processing steps (e.g., XSLT transformations) are connected together
                    using a pipeline metaphor. Orbeon has implemented an XML pipeline engine in Java
                    that executes a declarative XML pipelining language called <a
                    href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2005/SUBM-xpl-20050411/">XPL</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Programming" pipelines using declarative XML instead of writing procedural
                    code results in a significant increase in productivity for tasks that require
                    high volume or complex XML processing. XML documents enter a pipeline, are
                    efficiently processed by one or more processors as specified by XPL
                    instructions, and are then output for further processing, display, or storage.
                    XPL features advanced capabilities such as document aggregation, conditionals
                    ("if" conditions), loops, schema validation, caching, and sub-pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XML pipelines are built up from smaller components called XML processors. An
                    XML processor is a software component which consumes and produces XML documents.
                    New XML processors are most often written in Java, but most often developers do
                    not need to write their own processors because the engine provides a
                    comprehensive library. Example processors include an XSLT processor, database
                    processors that interface with both SQL and native XML databases, and a
                    serializer processor that writes XML documents to disk. XPL orchestrates these
                    to create business logic, similar to the way Java code "orchestrates" Java
                    object method calls.

                    Language (XPL)</a>. XPL is a declarative language for processing XML using a
                    pipeline metaphor. XML documents enter a pipeline, are efficiently processed by
                    one or more processors as specified by XPL instructions, and are then output for
                    further processing, display, or storage. XPL features advanced capabilities such
                    as document aggregation, conditionals ("if" conditions), loops, schema
                    validation, and sub-pipelines.

                    The Orbeon XPL pipeline engine used in Orbeon Forms is designed for
                    low-memory consumption and supports transparent caching.

                <p>
                    The term XML processor is commonly used to refer to XML parsers. In the context
                    of Orbeon Forms, the term
                    <i>XML processor</i> is used to refer to
                    any software component consuming and/or producing XML documents. An XML
                    processor can also simply be called an
                    <i>XML component</i>.

                    This particular example illustrates a simple 2-stage XPL pipeline that performs an XSLT

                    another file on disk. For more details about XPL, please see the <a

                <title>How does caching work in Orbeon Forms?</title>
                <p>
                    Caching mechanisms should have no impact on the behavior of a system, except
                    for a gain in performance. This is also the principle followed by the
                    Orbeon Forms cache: when you develop an application with
                    Orbeon Forms, you should be able to ignore that caching takes place. This
                    may be all you want to know about caching in Orbeon Forms!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get a better understanding of the underlying mechanism,
                    consider the example below:
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="../apps/doc/images/faq-caching.png" width="461" height="154"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Let's assume the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The XSLT processor's
                        <code>config</code> input is an XSLT stylesheet on disk
                    </li>
                    <li>The XSLT processor's
                        <code>data</code> input is an XML file on disk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The XSLT stylesheet does not contain imports, includes,
                        the document() function, or calls to Java code.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Under those assumptions, the XSLT transformation does not have side effects, which means that if
                    neither the XSLT stylesheet ( <code>config</code> input) nor the input XML document (
                    <code>data</code> input) change, the output of the transformation will be the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were to keep the result of the transformation, knowing that both inputs have not changed
                    since the last time you generated that output, you wouldn't have to actually run the transformation
                    again: you could just reuse the result you already have. This is the basic of caching in Orbeon
                    Forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this example, the result of the XSLT transformation is used to create an XUpdate processor
                    configuration, which is an XUpdate program that will be interpreted or compiled by the XUpdate
                    processor. Instead of keeping the result of the XSLT transformation as an XML document, the XUpdate
                    processor can cache the compiled XUpdate program. Compared to a solution where the XML document is
                    cached, this technique saves memory by not keeping the XML document in cache, and saves processing
                    power by preventing the XUpdate processor to recompile its program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, if neither the XSLT transformer's <code>config</code> nor <code>data</code> input has
                    changed, the XUpdate processor can keep the same program in the Orbeon Forms object cache, saving
                    an XSLT stylesheet compilation, an XSLT transformation, and an XUpdate program compilation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same mechanism applies to the XSLT transformer configuration: the compiled XSLT stylesheet can
                    be kept in the Orbeon Forms object cache. And if the output of the XUpdate transformation is sent
                    to an HTML serializer, the HTML output could be cached as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, Orbeon Forms does not unnecessarily cache the XML documents passed between processors.
                    Instead, it caches the result of time-consuming operations, as illustrated above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some cases are more complex than the example shown here. For example in the case of XSLT 1.0, Orbeon
                    Forms handles caching and dependencies related to imports, includes as well as the XPath
                    <code>document()</code> function when the URL passed to the function is static. Some processors,
                    like the SQL processors, never allow their output to be cached.

                <p>
                    The Orbeon Forms cache avoids executing the parts of a pipeline that do
                    not need to be re-evaluated. However when the a debug attribute is set, the
                    point where the attribute is set needs to be evaluated so that meaningful data
                    can be displayed. This can cause the performance to degrade. Debug attributes
                    should be removed in production.

                <title>When invoking a processor in XPL, what is the difference between a name and an id?</title>
                <p>
                    Processors can be compared to functions in traditional programming languages.
                    Processors (just like functions) have inputs (arguments) and outputs (return
                    values). Each input and output has a <i>name</i>. The name is part of the
                    processor's interface. For instance, using an informal function-like notation,
                    the XSLT processor interface is:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>(data) = xslt(data, config)</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    since the XSLT processor has 2 inputs named <code>data</code> and
                    <code>config</code>, and one output named <code>data</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface to a processor is the contract that defines what inputs and
                    outputs do. If you are using an existing processor, for example the XSLT
                    transformer, you have to use the names declared by that processor. To know what
                    names you must use, you have to consult the documentation for each processor. We
                    have tried to be consistent and to use "config" and "data" as often as possible.
                    You can for example call the XSLT transformer like this:
                </p>
                <xml-source show-namespaces="false">
                    <p:processor name="oxf:xslt" xmlns:p="http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/pipeline">
                        <p:input name="config" href="stylesheet.xsl"/>
                        <p:input name="data" href="input.xml"/>
                        <p:output name="data" id="my-output"/>
                    </p:processor>
                </xml-source>
                <p>
                    A pipeline can also be viewed as a processor. If that pipeline decides to
                    export inputs and outputs, it must do so using the <code>&lt;p:param
                    name="..."/></code> syntax. This defines its interface. You can compare this to
                    writing your own method in Java, as opposed to using an existing method. The
                    difference is that in Java, you address method parameters by position when you
                    call a method. In XPL, you always address them by name. Therefore it is
                    important to use the right name when you call a processor (or a pipeline).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also applies to the cases where the Web Application Controller calls your
                    own pipelines: the PFC has to know the names of the inputs and outputs to
                    connect to. Therefore, you have to use the names ( <code>data</code> and
                    <code>instance</code>) <a
                    href="http://www.orbeon.com/ops/doc/processors-controller">documented</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you implement a pipeline or write a new processor in Java, and you don't
                    have any external naming constraints (such as the ones defined by the PFC, or
                    if somebody expects to call your pipeline using names defined in advance), you
                    are free to use any name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In XPL an <i>id</i> can be assigned to an output when invoking a processor. This
                    id can then be used latter on in the same pipeline to refer to that specific
                    output, and for instance connect it to the input of another processor. Ids are
                    similar to variable names in most programming languages.

                <p>
                    By default Orbeon Forms makes two uses of the string <code>oxf:</code>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                            <b>As an XML namespace prefix in XPL.</b> The XML namespace prefix <code>oxf</code> is
                            typically mapped to the XML namespace URI <code>http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors</code>.
                            This namespace is used to resolve XML qualified names (also referred to as "QNames") that
                            identify the built-in XML processors in XPL, such as <code>oxf:xslt</code>. These are
                            constructs specific to XML.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>As a URL scheme.</b> The <code>oxf</code> URL scheme is used to address Orbeon Forms
                            resources through the Orbeon Forms <a href="reference-resource-managers">Resource
                            Manager</a>. They are part of URLs such as <code>oxf:/config/properties.xml</code>. Such
                            URLs are supported throughout the Orbeon XForms XPL engine and XForms engine.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    You created your own application based on the Orbeon Forms examples, and now you would like to get
                    rid of the left navigation bar with that list of examples, as well as any other examples-specific look
                    and feel.

                <p>
                    The left navigation bar and other "decorations" are added to all the examples in what is called a
                    <i>theme</i>. The theme is implemented in an XSLT stylesheet, and that stylesheet is applied to all
                    the pages generated by your application. This is setup in <code>config/epilogue-servlet.xpl</code>.
                    In that file, look for the comment "Apply theme". Below that comment, you will see some code in XPL
                    which depending on the path applies either the theme <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> (no decoration) or
                    <code>theme-portal.xsl</code> (examples portal decoration). Most likely you want to use
                    <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> for all the page of your application. You can do so by replacing the
                    whole <code>&lt;p:choose></code> with the first <code>&lt;p:processor></code> inside the
                    <code>&lt;p:choose></code>, the one that applies the <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> theme. After this
                    modification, the relevant section of your <code>epilogue-servlet.xpl</code> will read:
                </p>

                    If you wish to add some specific look and feel to all your pages, you might want to create your own

                <p>
                    If you get the white IE error page with the message "Cannot find server or DNS server error" when
                    navigating to another page, it most likely means that the length of the URL for that page exceeds
                    the limit imposed by IE. This can happen if you are passing an XForms instance from one page to
                    another with a redirect. The solution often involves changing in your <code>properties.xml</code>
                    the value of the <code>instance-passing</code> property for the processor
                    <code>oxf:page-flow</code> from <code>redirect</code> to <code>forward</code>.

                <p>
                    The <code>instance-passing</code> can be defined at application level in
                    <code>properties.xml</code>, the page flow level, or the <code>&lt;result></code> element level. See
                    the changes in version 2.5 for <a href="home-changes-25#instance-passing">more information about

                <p>
                    In general, you get this error when the encoding on your XML file missing or is
                    incorrect. In the example above, we had specified the encoding to be ISO-8859-1,
                    while editing the file on a Windows machine. The file contained a dash encoded
                    as the character 150 in decimal, 96 in hexadecimal, which is not a valid
                    character for the ISO-8859-1 encoding. In this case changing the encoding to
                    windows-1252 solves the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifying ISO-8859-1 instead of windows-1252 on files that contain characters
                    invalid in ISO-8859-1 does sometimes work, but not always. In particular, more
                    recent versions of Saxon became stricter checking for invalid characters. So
                    we recommend you use windows-1252 instead of ISO-8859-1 when appropriate. You
                    specify the windows-1252 encoding by starting your XML file with the following
                    XML declaration:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?>
                </code>
                <p>

                <title>I am concerned about the performance of Orbeon Forms. Can you provide performance numbers please?</title>
                <p>
                    We provide recommendations on how to tune Orbeon Forms applications in the <a
                    href="integration-tuning">Performance and Tuning</a> section. Orbeon does not
                    provide performance figures at this point, due to the number of different
                    possible scenarios, the differences between hardware platforms, and the
                    different expectations of users. We believe that the best way to tackle
                    performance questions is to go beyond theory and work on a small but
                    representative prototype. Orbeon can help you build that prototype, a task often
                    done in just a few days. Upon completion of the prototype, you can evaluate
                    whether the performance of the prototype is satisfying or not, and if not, Orbeon
                    can help you determine whether and how performance can be improved. The final
                    appreciation belongs to you.

                    <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon 8</a> is used by default within Orbeon Forms. It has proven
                    reliable, and supports the latest <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/">XSLT 2.0</a> and <a

                <p>
                    XSLT performance can vary greatly depending on the XSLT processor used. In
                    general, XSLT performance has shown perfectly adequate for all but the most
                    performance-intensive applications. This being said, Orbeon Forms
                    minimizes the performance hit with its advanced cache, which for example caches
                    objects such as XSLT templates, therefore avoiding reparsing and revalidating
                    stylesheets unless absolutely necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orbeon Forms also ships with XSLTC, an XSLT compiler now part of Apache
                    Jakarta. XSLTC has shown significant performance improvements over the regular
                    Xalan implementation, at the cost of a lack of maturity.

                <title>Is XSLTC a mature product?</title>
                <p>
                    XSLTC is not quite mature yet and caution must be exercised when using it. If
                    you plan to use XSLTC, we recommend extensive testing as well as switching back
                    and forth between XSLTC and the regular Xalan implementation during development
                    to ensure proper behavior. We also recommend <a

                    project if necessary.

                    How can I parse a string containing XML into a document that Orbeon Forms can process?
                </title>

                    <p>
                        Use the XSLT transformer and the
                        <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/extensions/functions.html">
                            <code>saxon:parse</code>
                        </a>
                        function. This function parses an XML document supplied as a string and returns
                        a document node. To copy the resulting document to the output of your XSLT
                        transformation, use
                        <code>xsl:copy</code>. For example, assuming your input
                        document is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <xml-source>
                        <document>
                            <xml-string>
                                &lt;name&gt;
                                &lt;first&gt;John&lt;/first&gt;
                                &lt;last&gt;Smith&lt;/last&gt;
                                &lt;/name&gt;
                            </xml-string>
                        </document>
                    </xml-source>
                    <p>
                        Consider also the following XSLT transformation:
                    </p>
                    <xml-source>
                        <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:saxon="http://saxon.sf.net/" version="2.0">
                            <xsl:template match="/">
                                <xsl:copy-of select="saxon:parse(/document/xml-string)"/>
                            </xsl:template>
                        </xsl:stylesheet>
                    </xml-source>
                    <p>
                        Running this transformation on the input document above generates the following
                        output:
                    </p>
                    <xml-source>
                        <name>
                            <first>John</first>
                            <last>Smith</last>
                        </name>
                    </xml-source>
                    <p>
                        This tip is particularly useful for parsing XML strings returned by EJBs, Web
                        Services, or entered by a user in XForms textarea controls.

                                might first want to see where in the Java code threads are blocked. To do so, on

                                server is running; on Linux identify the process id of the JVM running

                    This is a Saxon issue. It might happen when in the input document of a
                    stylesheet or in the output of the stylesheet you have an element declared with
                    no prefix as the child of an element with a prefix. One way to get around this
                    is to add a prefix to all the element having a parent declared with a prefix.

                    Efforts around the XUpdate language appear to be stalled. XML databases now
                    tend to bid on proprietary extensions to the standard XQuery language (e.g. see
                    what Tamino does, and there are talks about implementing something similar in
                    the open source eXist database). In the future, XQuery will support standard
                    update features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do recognize that XUpdate has definite advantages over XSLT in certain use
                    cases (which is why we implemented it in the first place), but it seems that the
                    market is currently not supporting what is considered "yet another XML
                    transformation language".
                </p>
                <p>
                    For use as a general-purpose XML update language with Orbeon Presentation
                    Server, we now recommend using XSLT. Use either XSLT 1.0 or XSLT 2.0 (12
                    November 2003 Draft as implemented by Saxon) instead of using the XUpdate
                    processor. The only place where XUpdate is not deprecated is within Page Flow,
                    but only a subset of XUpdate is required and you can simply consider that it is
                    part of the Page Flow syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This being said, our XUpdate implementation is functional and of course anybody
                    is free to use it or contribute to it. Like the rest of Orbeon Forms, it
                    is available under the LGPL license.

                <title>How can I debug the XUpdate code in my page flow?</title>
                <p>
                    Insert at the very beginning of the in the XUpdate code those 3 lines to log the
                    instance being modified (instance of target page), the current instance, and
                    the output of the action pipeline:
                </p>
                <xml-source show-namespaces="false" xmlns:xu="http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate">
                    <xu:message>Instance of target page before XUpdate: <xu:copy-of select="/*"/></xu:message>
                    <xu:message>Instance of this page: <xu:copy-of select="doc('oxf:instance')/*"/></xu:message>
                    <xu:message>Action output: <xu:copy-of select="doc('oxf:action')/*"/></xu:message>
                </xml-source>
                <p>
                    Then as the very last instruction in the XUpdate code, add:
                </p>
                <xml-source show-namespaces="false" xmlns:xu="http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate">
                    <xu:message>Instance of target page after XUpdate: <xu:copy-of select="/*"/></xu:message>

                <p>
                    If this exception is thrown from the class TransformerImpl class in a Xalan
                    package (<code>orbeon.apache.xalan.transformer</code>), a bug in Xalan is at
                    the source of the problem. Xalan calls the SAX <code>startElement()</code>
                    method with an attribute that has an empty local name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switching to Saxon solves the problem. Saxon is now the default XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 processor in
                    Orbeon Forms, and will get used when using <code>oxf:xslt</code>. See the <a

                    This usually happens when you use XInclude. As per the <a

                    Often, this is due to too many threads doing processing within Orbeon Forms at the same time. There
                    is just a lot going on in Orbeon Forms when a request is processed, including typically several XSLT

                <title>Orbeon Forms Java stack traces are very long. Does that mean that performance is necessarily bad?</title>
                <p>
                    Java stack traces are indeed very long in Orbeon Forms. This is due mainly to the nature
                    of XPL pipelines, which are implemented on top of the event-based SAX API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality you cannot make any reasonable conclusion about performance just by
                    looking at the length of a typical stack trace: you would have in addition to
                    that to look at the pattern of execution of those methods. For example, if every
                    top-level method call was going through, say, 300 levels of method calls, this
                    would likely be an issue, but it is not the case in Orbeon Forms. The bottom line is that
                    no, the length of a stack trace does not directly correlate with poor
                    performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reach valid conclusions about performance, run a tool like <a
                    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">Apache JMeter</a> on your application.

                <title>In Studio, why nothing shows up in the XPL Trace Views?</title>
                <p>
                    The XPL Trace facility provides information for a given page served by Orbeon Forms. For that page,
                    it shows a tree of processor calls and indicates on that tree how much time has been spent on each
                    node. This information collected by XPL Trace can be either sent to the standard output, or to
                    Studio. When sent to Studio, it will be shown in the XPL Trace Table and XPL Trace Tree views. For
                    this to work as expected:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You need to setup the port Studio listens to, from Preferences / Orbeon. That port must match
                        the one you have setup in Orbeon Forms <a href="reference-properties#trace">properties</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After changing the port number in Studio, you might have to restart
                        Eclipse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For Studio to listen on the specified port, you need to have two views (XPL
                        Trace Table and XPL Trace Tree) open. You might also need to at least make
                        one of the views active before Studio starts listening on the specified
                        port. On Windows, you can check if Studio is listening on the port you
                        specified using <a

                            Make you don't have any "Address already in use" error in the Console
                            view when you start the application server. If you do, it means that you
                            already have another application (other program, or other Orbeon Forms
                            application maybe deployed in the same application server) using the
                            same port. On Windows, you can use <a
                            href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/tcpview.shtml">TCPView</a>
                            to determine what application is using the port you mention in the
                            <code>log4j.xml</code>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Make sure you don't have any filter setup in Logging Events view by
                            right-clicking on the "down arrow" icon and selecting "Filters".
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To populate the Logging Events view, Studio connects to log4j, and
                            log4j listens on the port specified in the log4j.xml file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is nothing in the Studio preferences to tell Studio to which port
                            it should connect. Instead, Studio finds the port by looking at all the
                            log4j.xml files you have in all the open projects. It will then try to
                            connect to all the ports specified those files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If log4j was able to listen on the port specified in your log4j.xml (see
                            point 1 above) and still no messages appear in the Logging Events view,
                            that might be because Studio cannot find your log4j.xml. So make sure
                            that this file is in an open project defined in the Studio. Also note
                            that if you modify this file outside of Eclipse with an external
                            program, Studio won't pick up that modification. In that case, in the
                            Navigator view, right click on the project that contains your log4j.xml
                            and choose Refresh. Right after this, events should start to appear in
                            the Logging Event view as you load pages in the browser.
