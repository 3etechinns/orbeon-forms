            <p>
                Welcome to the reference documentation for the Orbeon Forms platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms is an open source forms solution that handles the complexity of forms typical of the
                enterprise or government. It is brought to standard web browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox,
                Safari and Opera) thanks to Ajax technology, with no need for client-side software or plugins. Orbeon
                Forms allows you to build fully interactive forms with features that include as-you-type validation,
                optional and repeated sections, always up-to-date error summaries, PDF output, full
                internationalization, and controls like auto-completion, tabs, dialogs, trees and menus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike other web application frameworks based on Java objects or scripting languages, Orbeon Forms is based on
                XML documents and XForms. This leads to an architecture perfectly suited for the tasks of capturing,
                processing, and presenting XML data, and does not require writing any Java or scripting code at all to
                implement a dynamic presentation layer for your web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms is built around a user-friendly Ajax-based XForms engine, which brings standard W3C XForms to
                mainstream browsers, and the <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL engine</a>, a mature,
                high-performance XML pipeline engine for processing XML data.

                        <a href="reference-xforms-ng"><b>XForms.</b></a> XForms is the W3C standard for creating

                        of your Orbeon Forms application. It defines your application's pages and how you navigate
                        between them.

                        allows you to implement lightweight processes that handle XML data, without writing a single
                        line of Java or other scripting language.

                        services such as accessing databases, performing data transformations, calling web services, and
                        more. If you need more, you can write your own XML components.
