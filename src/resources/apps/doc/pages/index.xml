            <p>
                Welcome to the reference documentation for the Orbeon Forms platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms is an open source forms solution that handles the complexity of forms typical of the
                enterprise or government. It is delivered to standard web browsers (including Internet Explorer,
                Firefox, Safari and Opera) thanks to XForms and Ajax technology, with no need for client-side software
                or plugins. Orbeon Forms allows you to build fully interactive forms with features that include
                as-you-type validation, optional and repeated sections, always up-to-date error summaries, PDF output,
                full internationalization, and controls like auto-completion, tabs, dialogs, trees and menus. Orbeon
                Forms already supports most of the XForms 1.1 specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms is built around a user-friendly Ajax-based XForms engine, which brings W3C XForms to
                standard browsers, and the <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL engine</a>, a mature, high-performance
                XML pipeline engine for processing XML data.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of the XForms engine, Orbeon Forms includes Form Runner (a runtime environment for forms) and <a
                href="http://www.orbeon.com/forms/builder">Orbeon Form Builder</a> (a web-based form builder).
