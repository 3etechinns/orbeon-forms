                This example shows how you can propagate a state from page to page with XForms. Here
                the state is a number. This number is displayed and you can either:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>increment it</li>
                <li>or set its value to zero.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The state is stored in the instance. The instance is declared as follows in the XForms
                model. The HTML form is generated in the view. The initial value of the counter is set
                to zero in the XForms model (see the <code>counter</code> element where the instance is
                declared). The value of the counter is also displayed in the view with
                <code>&lt;xforms:output ref="counter"/&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value of the instance is changed in the model. To make the change, the model needs
                to know if the user pressed the "reset" or the "increment" button. This is done by
                looking at the content of the <code>action</code> element in the instance document. The
                value of this element is set to the <code>id</code> of the button that was pressed.
            </p>
