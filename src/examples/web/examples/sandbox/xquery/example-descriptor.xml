        <p>
            XQuery is an XML query language being developed by the W3C.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page lets you experiment with the XQuery processor by writing your own XQuery
            program, and running on a given input document. XQuery support in PresentationServer
            uses the <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a> XQuery engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information about XQuery, visit the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery Web site</a>.
