                This example shows how to declare the site navigation logic in the Page Flow
                Controller configuration. This way the site navigation logic is kept separate from the
                pages themselves, thus achieving a better separation of concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example emulates a very simple ATM machine. The diagram on the right exposes the
                logic of the ATM. Each page in this application is extremely simple and the interesting
                part lies in the navigation logic between pages.
