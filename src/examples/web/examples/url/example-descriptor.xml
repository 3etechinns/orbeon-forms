            Presentation Server loads resources URLs (<code>oxf:</code>, <code>http:</code>,
            etc...) with the help of the URL Generator. It then parses the XML file. The URL
            Generator is configurable to use a validating XML parser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The URL Generator can optionally <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a> its
            output, allowing Presentation Server to transform any HTML page into XHTML. To
            demonstrate this feature, this page loads the <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN.com</a>
            home page and uses XPath to extract the main headline.
