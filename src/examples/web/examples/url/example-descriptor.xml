                OPS loads resources URLs (<code>oxf:</code>, <code>http:</code>, etc...) with the
                help of the URL generator. It then parses XML files. The URL fenerator is
                configurable to use a validating XML parser.

                The URL Generator can optionally <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a> its
                output, allowing OPS to transform any HTML page into XHTML. To demonstrate this
                feature, this page loads the <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN.com</a> home page and
                uses XPath to extract the main headline.
