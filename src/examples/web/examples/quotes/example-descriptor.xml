    <title>Random Quotes</title>

            <p>
                This example calls a remote Web service to get a random
                quote and then displays that quote or a new quote every
                time the page is loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                It shows the separation between the model and view (there is
                no a model in the previous examples). Here, the model is
                responsible for calling the Web service and the view for
                displaying the quote. The Web service represents the
                back-end and the quote represents the front-end.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remote Web service is called <code>model.xpl</code> by
                using the <a href="../doc/processors-delegation">delegation
                processor</a>:
            </p>
            <p>
                The Web service is declared to call the
                <code>interface</code> input containing the endpoint, the
                operation, and the namespace URI for that operation. The
                service is called through the
                <code>&lt;delegation:execute&gt;</code> element of the
                <code>call</code> document.
            </p>
            <p>
                The view for this example is pretty straightforward: it
                simply displays the text of the quote received from the
                model.
            </p>
