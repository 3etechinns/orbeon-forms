        This example shows how to create a custom processor, and how to use it in a pipeline through
        the Java processor. Here the custom processor (<a
        href="/javaprocessor/SystemProperties.java.html">view source</a>) generates an XML document
        with the Java system properties. The properties are then displayed in a table by the view.
