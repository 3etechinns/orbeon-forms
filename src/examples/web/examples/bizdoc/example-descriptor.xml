            BizDoc is a sample application that illustrates basic business document manipulation.
            Fictitious claim documents are created, read, updated, and deleted from a database. It
            is the basis for the Orbeon Presentation Server Tutorial - please refer to the <a
            href="/doc/pages/Tutorial.pdf" f:url-type="resource">Presentation Server Tutorial</a> for the complete
            documentation of this example.
