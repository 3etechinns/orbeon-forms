                This translates on the fly the text that you type. Keystrokes are intercepted on the
                browser with JavaScript code, which builds an XML document with the text typed so far
                and sends it to PresentationServer, which run a pipeline. The pipeline makes standard
                HTTP request to the Google Language Tool page, essentially simulating a user filling
                submitting a form on their site. Then the pipeline extracts the outcome of the
                translation and sends it back to the browser in an XML document. When the browser
                receives this information, it displays it in the read-only text field.
