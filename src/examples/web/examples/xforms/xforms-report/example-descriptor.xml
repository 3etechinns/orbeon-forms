                This example shows how you can build a sortable table, where the contents of the table can be sorted by
                the values of each column.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can select how the data is sorted by clicking on the icon in the column header. The sort order goes
                from "no sort", to "sort ascending", to "sort descending", and back to "no sort".
