            This page shows how HTML controls can be mixed with links in the same form to create a
            "report table", where you can choose how the data is sorted and what columns are
            displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the table below you can select:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What columns you want to display with the checkboxes on the right.
            </li>
            <li>
                How the data in the table is sorted by clicking on the icon next to the column
                header. The sort order will go from "no sorting", to "ascending", to "descending",
                back to "no sorting".
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The XForms instance is displayed at the bottom of the page and you can see how it is
            changed as you change the columns to display and the sort order.
