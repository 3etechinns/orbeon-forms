    <title>XForms Text Controls</title>
    <source>form.xml</source>
    <source>view.xsl</source>
    <description>
        <p>
            Shows the XForms text controls: textfield, password textfield and text area.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first time you load this page, the first two checkboxes are
            selected. This is because they are both <a
            href="source?src=xforms-default/xforms.xml">listed in the XForms
            Model</a> and are therefore considered as default values.</li>

            <li>If you change the checkbox selection and submit the form, the
            page is displayed again and the checkboxes are automatically populated
            per your selection. The includes the case where you have unselected all
            the checkboxes before submitting the form.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: This example uses checkboxes, but the same logic applies to all
        the XForms controls.</p>
