        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            This XForms example is based on a <a
            href="http://skimstone.x-port.net/index.php?q=node/89">tutorial</a> by Mark Birbek. It
            illustrates connecting to a Flickr service to query images, and then displays them while
            resizing them.
