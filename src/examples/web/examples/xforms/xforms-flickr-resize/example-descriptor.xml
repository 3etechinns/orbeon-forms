    <title>Resizing Images With XForms and Flickr</title>
    <xi:include href="example-descriptor-files.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude"/>
    <description>
        <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <p>
                This XForms example is based on a <a
                href="http://skimstone.x-port.net/index.php?q=node/89">tutorial</a> by Mark Birbek.
                It illustrates connecting to a Flickr service to query images matching certain tags,
                and then displaying them while allowing for resizing them with a slider.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we made the following changes compared to the tutorial version:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Updated XPath expression to use XPath 2.0 <code>if()</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Updated CSS rules, as OPS does not as of yet support the
                        <code>xforms\:something</code> notation in CSS, but uses classes of the
                        form <code>.xforms-something</code> instead.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also made the following minor changes, mainly for improved usability and
                appearance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Set a default value of "flower" in the "tags" input field.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Set the minimum slider value to 10 instead of 1.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Used more explicit labels, some descriptive text, and updates to layout and
                        style.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The submission can be done also by pressing "enter" in the input field (
                        <code>DOMActivate</code> runs <code>xforms:send</code> ).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Added <code>xforms:output</code> control to display the current value of
                        the slider, as the OPS slider does not show the numerical value by default.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Put hidden <code>&lt;span></code> in the repeat so that IE flows the
                        images correctly.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </description>
