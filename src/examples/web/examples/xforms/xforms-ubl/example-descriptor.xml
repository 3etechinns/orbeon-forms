            When the end-user fills the form below, an XML document is created with the form data.
            In this example, the XML document represents an order, as specified by the <a
            href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/">OASIS Universal Business Language</a>
            (UBL) specification. You can view this document by clicking on the "View XForms
            Instance" button below.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a developer, you describe the XML document in the XForms model, and the UI with
            XForms controls embedded in XHTML. Events are handled on the server side, which gives
            you the full flexibility of OXF when handling events. This page implements the
            "real-word example" provided by Micah Dubinko in his book <a
            href="http://dubinko.info/writing/xforms/book.html#id2800591">XForms Essentials</a>.
