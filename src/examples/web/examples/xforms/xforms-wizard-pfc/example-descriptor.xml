            In some cases, it makes sense to create a multiple-pages interface to fill out a single
            logical form. Such wizard-like user interfaces are typically used to make the user
            experience more intuitive, or when different sections in the form need to be filled out
            based on previous answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example below is an example of a simple wizard: the first 3 steps ask questions to
            the end-user and the last step displays the information entered in the previous steps.
            There only one XForms model for the whole wizard, and the navigation logic is defined in
            the Page Flow Controller configuration file, as illustrated by the diagram below.
