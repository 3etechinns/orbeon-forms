            <p >
                The <i>To Do Lists</i> example application illustrates many cool XForms features,
                such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Nested <code>xforms:repeat</code>: serveral to do lists can each contain
                        several items.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use of the <code>relevant</code> model item property for conditional
                        display of controls.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Automatic formatting of values with type <code>xs:date</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use of multiple XForms instances.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use of <code>xforms:setfocus</code> and <code>xforms:setindex</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There is currently no persistence of the data edited, but the example could be
                enhanced with a simple XML-based backend.
