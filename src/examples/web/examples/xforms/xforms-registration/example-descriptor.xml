                Errors in XForms can be styled with CSS, but not all cases can be handled just
                with CSS. For instance, CSS can't be used to control where error messages are
                displayed (next to the control, at the top of the page in a summary of all the
                errors), or to start displaying errors for a control only after the user started
                typing in that control.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example shows how you can implement custom error handling in XForms by adding
                annotations to the instance, using model item properties, and using
                <code>&lt;xforms:group></code> and <code>&lt;xforms:output></code> in the HTML to
                display errors in the HTML.
