            You can upload JPEG images with the form below. The uploaded images are received in
            the XForms instance as an <code>xs:anyURI</code> type, and then either sent directly to
            the Web browser, to an external Web service, or as a BLOB to a relational database.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of the simple file upload, the first image is sent directly to the Web
            browser. The model makes sure that the Binary serializer is used, and no page view is
            called.
        </p>
        <p>
            The external Web Service stores the images on a public server and returns for each
            image an URL that points to the image data. The URL is then used to refer to the
            uploaded image from this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            When uploading the result to a database, images are streamed to the database and stored
            as BLOBs. An URL is generated to identify the first image in the database. When reading
            the image, a separate model is used to retrieve the image from the BLOB and send it to
            the Binary serializer.
