                This example illustrates the use of XSLT 2.0. It shows the <a
                href="/goto-source/knight/tour.xsl" f:url-type="resource">original <i>Knight's
                tour</i> example </a> written by Michael Kay. In addition, we pass the start case as
                a stylesheet parameter and we style the resulting output. <a
                href="/goto-source/knight/view.xsl" f:url-type="resource">This page view</a> also
                uses some XSLT 2.0 features, such as sequences and new XPath 2.0 functions.
            </p>
