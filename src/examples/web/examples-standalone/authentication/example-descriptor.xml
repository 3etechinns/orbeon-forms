                This example shows how:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can restrict the access to a page with the standard mechanism provided in your application server</li>
                <li>You can programmatically obtain the name of the currently logged in user, as well as other security related information</li>
                <li>You can implement a "logout" feature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you are not logged in (e.g. the first time you access this page), you will be
                redirected to a login page. After you have successfully logged in, a page will display
                your user name and other authentication information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use admin/password as username and password.
            </p>
        </div>
