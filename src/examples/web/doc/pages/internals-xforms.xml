            <p>Currently in use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>$instance</code> – The instance, serialized as XML, compressed, gzipped,
                    stored in base64.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>$node^{id}</code> – Name of the HTML form elements. Form elements are
                    bound to a node in the instance and the end of the name if the node id (e.g.
                    <code>node^42</code>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>$submitted</code> – Set to 'true' when the form is submitted. When set,
                    the XForms engine does not take into account the instance from the XForms model,
                    but instead recreates the instance entirely from the request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>$upload^{1}^{2}^{3}^{4}^{5}^{6}^{7}</code> – Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>{1}: node id for file content</li>
                        <li>{2}: original value</li>
                        <li>{3}: node id for file name</li>
                        <li>{4}: current value of file name</li>
                        <li>{5}: node id for media type</li>
                        <li>{6}: current value for media type</li>
                        <li>{7}: node id for size</li>
                        <li>{8}: current id for size</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>$action^...</code> and <code>$actionImg^...</code> – Are used to store the
                    actions to be performed when a submit control is clicked. The value is create in
                    xforms-to-xhtml.xml (look for the xxforms:submit-name function). This value is used
                    as the name of form contro for submit buttons and images. For links, JavaScript is
                    generated to set the value of a hidden field to this value. The hidden field name
                    starts with wsrp_rewrite_action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the other parameter names are ignored by the XForms Input processor.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Obsolete:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>$hidden</code> – Was used to aggregate store the aggregation of all the
                    hidden variables. This is has been replaced by $instance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>$idRef</code>
