            <title>Getting The Source</title>
            <p>
                The source code of PresentationServer is available on the CVS repository hosted by
                ObjectWeb. To checkout the source code on your local machine, follow the
                instructions provided on <a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/scm/?group_id=168">the
                project CVS page</a> under the <i>Anonymous CVS Access</i>.

            <title>Building With Ant</title>
            <p>
                We build PresentationServer with Ant. The Ant configuration file (build.xml) is
                located at the root of the source directory. You can start Ant from the command line
                or if you are using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, use the builtin Ant support
                provided by your IDE. The PresentationServer build.xml defines a number of targets,
                but only a few are used frequently:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>orbeon-war</b>: Build PresentationServer and creates an exploded war file in the
                    directory <tt>build/ops-war</tt>. To test your modifications to the
                    PresentationServer code, you will typically run a Tomcat with a context pointing
                    to that directory. That context, defined in Tomcat's server.xml will typically
                    look like:</p>

                    <p><tt>&lt;Context crossContext="true" debug="0" docBase="path to your
                    source/build/ops-war" path="/ops" reloadable="false"/></tt></p>

                    <p><b>orbeon-dist-war</b>: This will build a "distribution" war file, which is
                    equivalent to the war file created by our automated build system and uploaded to

                    href="http://forge.objectweb.org/nightlybuilds/ops/ops/">directory</a>. The
                    produced file will be located in <tt>build/distrib/ops.war</tt></p>
