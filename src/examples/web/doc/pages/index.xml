            <p>Welcome to the Orbeon PresentationServer User Guide!</p>

            <p>
                Orbeon PresentationServer is a J2EE-based MVC framework for building Web
                applications that present and capture XML using XForms, XSLT, and Web Services.
                PresentationServer benefits from standardized forms processing using XForms, rich
                controller semantics, and full-featured XML pipelines. PresentationServer is in
                fact built around Orbeon's optimized XML pipeline engine, a mature, high-performance
                engine for pipeline processing of XML. PresentationServer is ideal for building
                Composite Applications in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), an can be used on
                its own, or within the <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/software/">OIS suite</a>.
