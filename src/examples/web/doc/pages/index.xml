            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Orbeon PresentationServer (OPS) User Guide, the reference OPS
                documentation!
            </p>
            <p>
                OPS is an open source J2EE-based platform for XML-centric web applications. OPS is
                built around XML technologies such as XHTML, XForms, XSLT, XML pipelines, and web
                services, which makes it ideal for applications that capture, process and present
                XML data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike other popular web application frameworks like Struts or WebWork which are
                based on Java objects and JSP, OPS is based on XML documents and XML technologies.
                This leads to an architecture better suited for the tasks of capturing, processing,
                and presenting information in XML format, and often does not require writing any
                Java code at all to implement the presentation layer of your web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                OPS is built around Orbeon's <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL engine</a>, a
                mature, high-performance XML pipeline engine for processing XML data.

            <title>Purpose of the User Guide</title>

            <p>
                The purpose of this guide is to get you acquainted with the main components of OPS:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <a href="reference-xforms"><b>XForms.</b></a> XForms is the W3C standard
                        for creating complex web forms.

                        <a href="reference-page-flow"><b>The Page Flow Controller (PFC).</b></a>
                        The PFC is the heart of your OPS application. It defines your application's
                        pages and how you navigate between them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines"><b>The XML Pipeline Definition Language
                        (XPL).</b></a> XPL allows you to implement lightweight processes that handle
                        XML data, without writing a single line of Java or other scripting language.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>OPS's built-in XML components.</b> The built-in OPS XML components
                        provide services such as accessing databases, performing data
                        transformations, calling web services, and more. If you need more, you can
                        write your own XML components.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                It is highly recommended to follow the <a href="Tutorial.pdf">OPS
                Tutorial</a> to get started with developing applications with OPS, and to refer to
                the User Guide as a reference.

                This guide should be accessible to anyone with some experience developing simple web
                applications. It is helpful to understand the basics of XML, Extensible Stylesheet
                Language Transformations (XSLT), and XForms before reading this documentation. For
                more information, consult the following sources as a starting point:
