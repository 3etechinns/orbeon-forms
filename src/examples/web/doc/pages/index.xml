            <p>Welcome to the Orbeon Presentation Server User Guide!</p>

            <p>
                Presentation Server is a native XML Web application platform that is purpose-built
                to automate document-centric business processes with web applications built directly
                from XML business documents. Although Presentation Server was designed primarily to
                develop Web applications, it can be used to build all sorts of XML applications,
                including Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Content Management Systems
                (CMS), and more. Presentation Server is part of the <a
